# Break Reminder

This is a simple Python script to remind you to take breaks while you work on your computer. It will open a web browser and play a video on YouTube after a set interval.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your computer.

### Installation

To use this script, simply clone the repository or download the `break_reminder.py` file.

### Usage

You can run the script using the following command:

```
python break_reminder.py
```

The script will then run and remind you to take breaks after a set interval. You can change the interval by modifying the `total_breaks` variable in the script.
